# CONFIG FILE FOR PATHBUILDER PROJECT PART 2 TESTING

# Blank lines are ignored.  Lines beginning with # are ignored.
# All other lines are processed.

# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# NOTE: THIS CONFIG FILE SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED.
# THE PARAMETERS AND CORRESPONDING RESULT ARE A SPECIFIC
# TEST PROVIDED FOR YOU TO CHECK YOUR PART 2 SOLUTION.
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

# This config file format is intended for use with
# Part2Test.java.

# NOTE: the GUI is not used for part 2 testing.

# NOTE: PLAYERS is not used in PART 2 config file.  The player
# to be tested is instead provided via a command line argument
# when running the program.  Also, TIMELIMIT is not specified
# in the config file, but internally a 10 second limit
# is used to limit the allowed computation by the player
# for any method call.

# PART must be present with value 2 to indicate that this
# file is appropriate for PART 2 testing
PART 2

# DIM is used to indicate the size of the smaller dimension
# of the grid of nodes for each player.
# It must have an integer value in the range 3-20.
# The larger dimension always has value DIM+1.
# Both players nodes can be placed on an overall grid of
# size (2*DIM+1) by (2*DIM+1).
# DIM has a default value of 6 if it is not specified in
# the configuration file.
DIM 6

# a PREMOVE is used to get the game started with
# a specific move before calling the
# HUMAN / player modules for moves.
# a PREMOVE must have three comma-separated values,
# with no spaces, indicating row, column and player id
# for the move.
# Multiple PREMOVE lines are allowed, and are processed in order.
# An invalid PREMOVE will cause a game error.
# PREMOVE lines are optional.

# NOTE: for Part 2 testing of the allLegalMoves method,
# the player to be tested will always be assigned a
# playerId that matches whose turn it is after the
# PREMOVEs are processed.
# The allLegalMoves method is called immediately
# after all PREMOVEs are processed.
# The allLegalMoves method also has a precondition
# that there is no winner in the game yet.
# Thus the PREMOVEs should not
# produce a winner.

# RESULT for part 2 contains two comma separated integer
# values (no spaces allowed before or after the comma).
# These are groundtruth values for this test indicating
# the fewest segments (edges) needed each
# for player 1 and 2, respectively, for victory.
# The player module output will be compared against
# these ground truth values.
RESULT 3,5
